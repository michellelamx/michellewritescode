    title: 'Product Manager',
    company: 'Slang.ai',
    quote: `Working with Michelle was a pure delight. She has such a natural affinity for interaction design and front-end work, it felt more like having a thought partner than any other engineer I've ever worked with.\n\nShe always went above and beyond to try to understand the end goal and desired user outcomes, and was never satisfied with the first solution at hand if it felt like there could be a better solution. She went out of her way to research other libraries and design opportunities to try to make sure that all stakeholders would have an end product that nailed the assignment, bringing multiple options to the table to review if the situation warranted.\n\nShe's also the fastest on front-end work I've ever seen, so we had our solutions in hand lightning fast.`
